# Tunez

The starter app for the upcoming Building Web Applications with Ash book.

This app was built using the latest versions of Elixir and Erlang, but will work with any reasonably recent version.

## Setup

* Run `npm install --prefix assets` to install JavaScript dependencies
* Run `mix setup` to install and setup Elixir dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
